/**
 * S4 — the break-glass merge-and-promote spine. On two-person approval of a break-glass grant, this
 * service turns the grant into a REAL, content-addressed promotion that reaches the serving PDP (S1),
 * instead of leaving an in-memory {@code issued} flag with no runtime effect.
 *
 * <p>It reuses the ordinary C5 lifecycle end to end — no bespoke promotion path:
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Ground the tenant's current active bundle</b> ({@link StudioGroundingProvider}, S3) — the same
 *       server-derived vocabulary / base ceiling / <em>current restriction child</em> a normal review uses.</li>
 *   <li><b>Merge</b> the emergency tuple into that current child ({@link BreakGlassPolicyCompiler}) —
 *       additive: normal grants are preserved, only the granted tuple carries the time-boxed ALLOW/DENY
 *       pair. NOT a deny-all-else that would revoke normal access.</li>
 *   <li><b>Assemble + review</b> the merged candidate ({@link GroundedStudioReviewService}), recording the
 *       DRAFTER as the verified review author.</li>
 *   <li><b>Sign the approval</b> ({@link ConsequenceApprovalService}) as the APPROVER — which re-enforces
 *       two-person SoD (author≠approver, per C1/H3) on the expedited path, on top of the C6
 *       {@link BreakGlassApprovalService} gate the controller already ran.</li>
 *   <li><b>Promote</b> ({@link PolicyPromotionService}) — verify signature, re-validate, probe,
 *       compare-and-set the live pointer, and load the bundle into the Cerbos-watched runtime dir so the
 *       merged grant actually enforces. On expiry the emergency tuple's CEL DENY fires inside the PDP while
 *       the rest of the bundle stays intact.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Authoring-plane only — it composes existing authoring-plane services and never touches
 * runtime-enforcement code ({@code PolicyAuthoringBoundaryArchTest} guards the promotion service it calls).
