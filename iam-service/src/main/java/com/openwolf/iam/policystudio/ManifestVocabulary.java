/**
 * The closed vocabulary a generated policy is allowed to reference, derived from the tenant's
 * manifests + base-ceiling schema (Axiom Story C2.3). This is the grounding contract: the
 * validator rejects any rule that names a resource kind, action, role, data-classification, or
 * attribute that is not in these sets.
 *
 * <p>World B: none of these values are hardcoded domain literals in Java — they are supplied by a
 * {@code ManifestVocabularyProvider} that reads them from the effective manifest / base ceiling.
 * The tests feed fixtures directly; production wiring supplies the same shape from config.
 *
 * @param resourceKind    the single Cerbos resource kind this policy targets (e.g. an agent kind)
 * @param actions         the finite set of manifest-declared actions valid for that resource
 * @param classifications the data-classification literals valid for that resource
 * @param attributes      the {@code R.attr.*} / {@code P.attr.*} attribute names a condition may name
 * @param roles           the principal roles a rule may name
 * @param approvedImports the {@code importDerivedRoles} modules a policy may import
