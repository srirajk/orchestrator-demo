/**
 * The port the consequence-diff service reads ground truth from (Axiom Story C4). A source evaluates a
 * {@link BundleSnapshot} over a batch of {@link FixtureCell}s and returns the real decisions — the
 * truth values the diff is built from. <b>Truth comes from a policy decision point, never from an
 * LLM.</b>
 *
 * <p>Two implementations sit behind this port:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link CerbosBatchDecisionSource} — the real PDP: an EPHEMERAL {@code docker run --rm} of the
 *       pinned Cerbos ({@code 0.53.0}, the runtime PDP version) running a {@code CheckResources}-shaped
 *       batch on a distinct container/temp dir, so it can never touch the running
 *       {@code conduit-cerbos} PDP. This is the evidence/production path.</li>
 *   <li>{@link LocalPdpDecisionSource} — the in-process C3 {@link PolicyExpectationEvaluator}, which
 *       reasons over the same closed decision set the runtime PDP emits. Fully reproducible with no
 *       Docker, so the harness pins the diff behaviour deterministically. (Same belt-and-braces split
 *       C3 uses: constrained fidelity evaluator for the reproducible number, real Cerbos for
 *       evidence.)</li>
 * </ul>
