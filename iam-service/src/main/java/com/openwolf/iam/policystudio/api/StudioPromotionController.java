/**
 * The C5 promotion WRITE surface — the marquee approve+promote flow. It composes two existing services
 * with zero new policy logic:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link ConsequenceApprovalService#approve} signs the human approval over the exact C4
 *       {@code consequenceReviewHash} (fails closed on a stale or tampered review);</li>
 *   <li>{@link PolicyPromotionService#promote} verifies that signature, stages + probes the candidate,
 *       and compare-and-sets the tenant's live policy pointer.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p><b>The C1 meta-authz is enforced here, at the API — all identity is VERIFIED, never a body field:</b>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>approver role</b> — {@code @PreAuthorize hasRole('policy_approver')};</li>
 *   <li><b>approver identity</b> — the authenticated {@code sub}. A null/absent principal fails closed
 *       ({@link StudioPrincipal#actor} throws), never skips the check;</li>
 *   <li><b>author≠approver</b> — the author is the VERIFIED identity that computed the referenced C4
 *       review (recorded server-side at {@code POST /reviews} time, never supplied in this request). The
 *       review is looked up by {@code reviewId} in the tenant-scoped store and a miss FAILS CLOSED (403).
 *       The approver may not be that author; this holds <em>regardless of role</em>, so a
 *       {@code platform_admin} is never an auto-approver of their own draft (C1.2/C1.3) → 409;</li>
 *   <li><b>tenant scope</b> — the principal's {@code tenant_id} claim. The review lookup is tenant-scoped
 *       (another tenant's reviewId resolves as not-found ⇒ fail closed) and the candidate's tenant must
 *       match. Tenant is NEVER read from a body field.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Server-side hash re-verification:</b> {@link ConsequenceApprovalService#approve} recomputes the
 * consequence-review hash from the review's truth fields and refuses to sign a tampered review, and blocks
 * a stale review (the active bundle drifted). See {@code docs/studio-api-contract.md} → "Known
 * service-layer hardening TODOs" for the checks {@code PolicyPromotionService.promote()} still does NOT
 * perform (GeneratedPolicyValidator re-run; hard-fail when the real Cerbos PDP is unavailable).
