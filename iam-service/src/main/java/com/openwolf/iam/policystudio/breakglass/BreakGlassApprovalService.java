/**
 * The two-person gate for issuing a break-glass grant (Axiom Story C6.4). It preserves the SAME
 * separation-of-duties invariant C1 enforces on ordinary policy approval via the
 * {@code policy_approval} Cerbos meta-authz (author≠approver; a superuser is not an auto-approver) —
 * emergency access is expedited, never single-person.
 *
 * <p>On approval the issuance is recorded to the tenant's A6 audit partition
 * ({@link BreakGlassAuditPartition#recordGranted}); each subsequent USE of the grant is recorded via
 * {@link #recordUse}. The grant itself is inert until compiled/promoted — this service authorizes
 * the issuance; the PDP alone enforces the time bound.
